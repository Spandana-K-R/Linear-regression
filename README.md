# Linear-regression

## Problem Statement:

We'll create a model that predicts crop yeilds for apples and oranges (target variables) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall and humidity (input variables or features) in a region. Here's the training data:

| Region | Temperature (F) | Rainfall (mm) | Humidity (%) | Apples (ton) | Oranges (ton) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
|Kanto | 73 | 67 | 43 | 56 | 70 |
|Johto | 91 | 88 | 64 | 81 | 101 |
|Hoenn | 87 | 134 | 58 | 119 | 133 |
|Sinnoh | 102 | 43 | 37 | 22 | 37 |
|Unova | 69 | 96 | 70 | 103 | 119 |

In a linear regression model, each target variable is estimated to be a weighted sum of the input variables, offset by some constant, known as a bias
